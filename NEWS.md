# artma (development version)

Initial pre-release version of **artma** (Automatic Replication Tools for Meta-Analysis).

This version introduces the core functionality of the package, offering a unified and user-friendly interface for conducting meta-analyses directly from data frames. Researchers can quickly specify parameters and run multiple commonly used meta-analytic models without writing boilerplate code.

Key features:

- Minimal setup: just provide a data frame and key column names.
- Run and compare several standard meta-analytic models.
- Emphasis on reproducibility and transparency throughout the workflow.
- Results are returned in a tidy, interpretable format ideal for reporting or further analysis.
- Designed to streamline the full analysis pipeline, from data preparation to interpretation.

Ideal for researchers seeking efficient, replicable meta-analyses without manually coding every step.

This is a development release and may evolve significantly before the 1.0.0 milestone.

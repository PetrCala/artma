# Quick Reference - artma Development

## Essential Commands

```bash
make deps         # First time setup - install dependencies
make test         # Run tests (fast feedback)
make lint         # Check code style
make check        # Full R CMD check
make all          # Run everything before PR
```

## Development Cycle

```bash
# 1. Make changes to code
# 2. Generate docs
make document

# 3. Run tests
make test

# 4. Check everything
make all
```

## Specific Tasks

```bash
make test-file FILE=test-name.R       # Run one test file
make test-filter FILTER=pattern       # Run tests matching pattern
make test-e2e                         # Run end-to-end tests
make coverage-report                  # Interactive coverage
make style                            # Auto-format code
make clean                            # Clean build artifacts
make dev                              # Load package interactively
make vignettes                        # Build vignettes
make fix-options                      # Validate option templates
make clear-cache                      # Clear package cache
```

## Before Committing

```bash
make all          # Must pass!
```

## Migration from run.sh

The old `./run.sh` commands have been replaced with `make` targets:

```bash
# Old command              → New command
./run.sh setup             → make setup
./run.sh test              → make test
./run.sh test --file <...> → make test-file FILE=<...>
./run.sh test --filter ... → make test-filter FILTER=...
./run.sh test-e2e          → make test-e2e
./run.sh lint              → make lint
./run.sh check             → make check
./run.sh document          → make document
./run.sh coverage          → make coverage
./run.sh build             → make build
./run.sh vignettes         → make vignettes
```

See `make help` for full list of commands.

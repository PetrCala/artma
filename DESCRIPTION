Description: This package provides a simple and unified interface for running a wide range of meta-analysis methods directly from your data. By inputting a data frame and specifying a few key options, users can effortlessly execute and compare multiple commonly used meta-analytic models. Designed to work out of the box, it enables researchers of all backgrounds to replicate and conduct their own meta-analyses without needing to manually implement each method. Ideal for transparency, reproducibility, and ease of use, the package streamlines the analytical workflow from data to results.
